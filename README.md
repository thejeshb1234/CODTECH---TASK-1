 DURATION - 30TH NOV 2024 TO 15TH JAN 20215

 Overview of the Project : 
Implement unit tests for a simple Java application using JUnit. This project
helps you understand the basics of unit testing and test-driven development
(TDD). Write unit tests for individual methods and classes. Use assertions to
validate test results.



Objective of the Project:
Implementing Unit Tests for a Simple Java Application Using JUnit
The primary objective of this project is to provide a hands-on understanding of unit testing and the principles of test-driven development (TDD) in Java. 
By writing and executing unit tests using JUnit, developers learn how to validate the correctness of individual methods and classes in a program.

Key Objectives:
Understand Unit Testing:

Learn the concept of testing individual units (methods or classes) in isolation.
Gain experience in verifying expected outputs and behavior under various conditions.
Familiarize with JUnit:

Use JUnit, a widely adopted testing framework for Java, to write and execute tests.
Explore core features of JUnit, such as assertions, annotations, and exception testing.
Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD):

Practice TDD by writing tests before implementing functionality.
Follow the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:
Red: Write a test that initially fails.
Green: Write code to pass the test.
Refactor: Improve the code while ensuring the test continues to pass.
Validate Code Behavior:

Use assertions to verify that methods return the expected results.
Test edge cases and handle exceptional conditions (e.g., divide by zero).
Enhance Code Quality:

Ensure reliability, robustness, and correctness of code through systematic testing.
Detect and fix bugs early in the development process.
Promote Modular Design:

Write testable, modular code with clearly defined methods and responsibilities.
Develop a habit of designing applications with testing in mind.



Explanation : 
Implementing Unit Tests for a Simple Java Application Using JUnit
Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that involves testing individual units of code in isolation to ensure they work as expected. By writing unit tests, developers can validate the functionality of specific methods and classes within an application. This process not only improves code quality but also aids in understanding the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the code itself.

What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable parts of an application, typically individual methods or functions. It ensures that these units behave as expected under various conditions, including edge cases.

What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?
TDD is a development methodology where tests are written before the implementation of functionality. The process typically follows these steps:

Write a failing test for a new feature.
Write just enough code to pass the test.
Refactor the code while ensuring the test still passes.
This iterative approach leads to robust, maintainable code and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs during development.
